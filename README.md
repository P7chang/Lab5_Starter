Explore Part 3:
Question 1: I wouldn't use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application because "message" feature involves multiple components, like text input fields, message threads, send buttons, and message display areas. We can divide the large feature into smaller parts and test each one.

Question 2: Yes, I would use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application because it has a clear input and output relationship, which is the app will prevent further input when the input has 80 characters. So we can implement unit tests using different lengths of input to test the output.
